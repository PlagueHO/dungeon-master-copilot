World information:A fantasy realm called on a world called Toril with a range of climates and enviornments with a long rich history.
Name: Toril
Description: Toril was the third planet from the Sun in Realmspace. It was orbited by one moon named Selûne, and by a cluster of asteroids, known as the Tears of Selûne. Throughout most of its history, Toril was known less commonly as Abeir-Toril. Toril was comparable in size to the planet Earth, with an equatorial circumference of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers). Its polar circumference was slightly smaller, at approximately 24,900 miles (40,100 kilometers). Toril consisted of various continents and islands, including Faerûn, Kara-Tur, and Zakhara in the central super-continent and throughout most of its history Anchorome, Maztica, and Katashaka in the western region of the world. 
History: The known history of Toril spans for thousands of years, extending back into the misty epochs after Ao sundered the world of Abeir-Toril after the Tearfall, splitting it into the two twin planets, Abeir and Toril1. The God Wars, also known as the Thousand-Year War, was a war that began the day Toril came under the rule of the New Gods. Upon the departure of the Old Gods, the New Gods, or the Gods of Toril, had been created to watch over the aspects of life, death, the elements, the arcane, and so on. The Second Sundering was a great catastrophic event in the history of the worlds of Abeir and Toril that took place during the decade of the 1480s DR.
